I want to build a MERN stack project in Replit that works as an AI Sales Girl using my VAPI credentials.

Project Requirements:
1. Tech stack: Node.js + Express.js backend (in Replit), MongoDB Atlas (my MONGODB_URI is stored as a secret), and a simple HTML/JS frontend (optional) to view logs.
2. The backend should have:
   - POST /api/logCall — Receives JSON data from VAPI containing:
        name, company, email, phone, status, notes, recording_url, timestamp
     and stores it in MongoDB.
   - GET /api/calls — Returns all stored calls in JSON.
   - GET / — A simple HTML table displaying all stored calls (no fancy CSS needed, just functional).
3. Integrate VAPI Webhook:
   - I will set my VAPI Agent to send call conversation data to /api/logCall.
   - The backend should accept JSON and handle errors gracefully.
4. MongoDB:
   - Use my provided MONGODB_URI secret in Replit.
   - Database name: salesdb
   - Collection name: calls
   - My MongoDB URI (to store in Replit secrets as MONGODB_URI):
     mongodb+srv://cehpoint:JIT2000%3E@cluster0.qqfryrj.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
5. Security:
   - Allow only requests containing a valid API key in headers (X-API-KEY) for POST /api/logCall (to protect against spam).
   - I will provide the API key and store it in Replit secrets.
6. Deployment:
   - The project should run fully inside Replit.
   - Once deployed, I will copy the public Replit URL and set it in my VAPI Agent’s webhook settings.
7. Testing:
   - Include a test POST request script in the repo so I can test without making a real VAPI call.

Additional Info:
- My VAPI credentials are:
   Public Key: 740abf27-9130-4ade-a3d0-477e8229d044
   Private Key: d98e80d8-9153-40f2-8f66-df366364247a
   Agent ID: b3870ff6-ed43-402e-bdba-14f65567e517
   Phone ID: 46b06452-9890-40f3-b046-80a7543f63c3
   SIP: sip:cehpoint-agent@sip.vapi.ai

Deliverables:
- Complete backend code in Replit.
- Instructions on how to run and connect with VAPI.
- Simple HTML frontend to view calls.
- API key protection for POST route.

Goal:
This project will allow my VAPI AI Sales Girl to make calls, collect lead info, and log it automatically in MongoDB, viewable in a basic dashboard.
